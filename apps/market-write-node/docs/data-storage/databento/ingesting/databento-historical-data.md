# Databento historical ingest

Historical backfills are handled by `scripts/tbbo-1m-1s.ts`.

They must produce the same canonical source-of-truth rows as live ingest.

## Input format

The script expects JSONL trade files:

- one JSON object per line
- not a JSON array
- typically downloaded or exported from Databento historical data tooling

Example:

```json
{"ts_recv":"2025-11-30T23:00:00.039353882Z","hd":{"ts_event":"2025-11-30T23:00:00.000000000Z","rtype":1,"publisher_id":1,"instrument_id":42140878},"action":"T","side":"N","depth":0,"price":"6913.500000000","size":1,"flags":0,"ts_in_delta":13803,"sequence":3353,"levels":[{"bid_px":"6915.750000000","ask_px":"6913.000000000","bid_sz":1,"ask_sz":1}],"symbol":"ESH6"}
```

## What the script does

1. read files line-by-line
2. skip non-trade records and spread contracts
3. classify trade side
4. feed the same shared rolling-window engine used by live ingest
5. upsert rows into `candles_1m_1s`
6. resume CVD from the latest stored rows before processing starts

The follow-up canonical rebuild step is:

7. read minute-boundary `candles_1m_1s` rows
8. build rolling `candles_1h_1m` rows

## Usage

```bash
pnpm --filter market-write-node historical:tbbo "/path/to/file1.json" "/path/to/file2.json"
```

or directly:

```bash
pnpm --filter market-write-node exec tsx scripts/tbbo-1m-1s.ts "/path/to/file1.json"
```

## Why the historical path matters

Backfills must match live behavior closely. Any change to:

- front-month stitching
- trade-side classification
- rolling-window warmup
- CVD handling

should be shared between live and historical ingest rather than implemented
twice.

This script is part of the source-of-truth writer pipeline, not a downstream
feature-generation pipeline.
