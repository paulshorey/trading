## TBBO data

A file like this is processed by `scripts/tbbo-1m-1s.ts`.

Important details:

- the file is JSONL, not a single JSON array
- real files are large, so the script reads them line-by-line
- each line is one trade record
- spread contracts such as `ESZ5-ESH6` are skipped
- the batch script should stay behaviorally aligned with the live stream path
- the batch script is part of the canonical source-of-truth writer pipeline
- after `tbbo-1m-1s.ts` fills `candles_1m_1s`, `candles-1h-1m.ts` can rebuild `candles_1h_1m`
