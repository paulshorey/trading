# Review of the retired monorepo

The reusable value is mainly market-data semantics and visualization, not a trading
strategy with demonstrated predictive value. All originals remain under
`archive/legacy/`; paths in the first column below are relative to that directory.

## Behaviors intentionally excluded

- `aggregatePriceData.ts` anchors normalization to the **last** available price. Fine
  as a descriptive chart transformation, but leaks future information as a feature.
- `aggregateDataUtils.ts` forward-fills and adds 12 hours of projected flat data.
  These are presentation conventions, not observed history or future targets.
- `rolling-window.ts` fills synthetic seconds and aggregates overlapping trailing
  windows. Naively resampling those as ordinary disjoint candles double-counts data.
- Old trade-side inference uses the midpoint only, without the full tick-test/time
  alignment methodology implied by its Lee–Ready name.
- OHLCV TradeBars do not contain aggressor side or book depth. CVD, imbalance and
  absorption must stay unavailable until genuine trade/quote inputs are added.
- Automated contract selection is not enough: positions, price adjustments, expiry,
  spread costs, multipliers and roll transactions must remain explicit.

## New research contract

`Bar` is a UTC minute interval with an opening timestamp and a known-at-close time.
`Strategy.on_bar` returns a desired position direction after observing a completed
bar. `Replay` separately applies the prior decision at the next observed bar open,
charges costs, marks equity and applies the drawdown rule. Its single-step and batch
paths are tested for equality; prefix tests ensure later data cannot change prior
results. This is shared decision logic, not proof of broker/live fill parity.

Start with transparent SMA and Wilder RSI baselines to validate infrastructure.
Advanced features and ML should earn their place through out-of-sample evaluation;
none of the old heuristic comments establish an edge.
